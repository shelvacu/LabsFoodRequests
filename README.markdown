# Labs Food Requests

## How to Request Food

1. Fork this repository (you'll need a Github account if you don't already have one).
1. Edit this file (README.markdown) using the online editor or your favorite desktop editor.
1. Under "Current Food Requests", add a line with the name of the restaurant, as well as a link to the Google Maps listing or site.
1. Commit your changes.
1. Open a pull request (https://github.com/StudentRND/LabsFoodRequests/compare/).

This might seem a bit obscure, but:

- if you haven't used pull requests, you'll learn about how they work.
- if you have used pull requests, you can tell people you ordered food with pull requests.
